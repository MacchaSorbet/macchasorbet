Thank you for buying my scriptset. ^-^

////////////////////////////////////
HOW TO USE
////////////////////////////////////

1 - Right click on your tail, and select edit.
2 - Click on the "Content" tab.
3 - Drag the tail script, and the three notecards into the content area.

Easy. ^-^
Now you can add your friends, unwanteds, enemies, and Ban people. ^-^

1 - In the content pane, double click the list you want to edit. This will open the list in an editor window.
2 - Simply add the full name of your friend, enemy, or unwanted into the appropriate list. One name per line.
3 - Save the note.

Next repeat for each of your ears, but instead of the tail script, drag the ears script. This means you can have different people on your lsits for tail as you do for ears.
Though you can easily take a copy of the list you setup for your tail and palce it onto your ears.

////////////////////////////////////
WHAT HAPPENS?
////////////////////////////////////

For people not in any of your lists, they will get the default, friendly messages.

People listed in your friends list will get a friendly, playful, message. You should use this list for people you are close too.

Those listed in your Unwanted list will get a simple message with very little fun. You should use this list for people who you don't hate, but whome you don't want using your tail for pleasure.

Those listed on your enemies list will get an insulting, or backfiring message. Use this for people you really don't like.

Those on your banned list will not be able to use your tail or ears at all.

TROUBLESHOOTING
////////////////////////////////////

If you have names in your lists but the scripts to not react correctly, try the following:

1 - Make sure that after you update the script you click on the appropriate body part and chose "reload" from the menu.
2 - Check that the names are correctly spelled.
3 - Check that there are not spaces before or after the name.
4 - Make sure that every name is on a new line with a return character at the end.

Sometimes you will find that you get a script error when you first install this script.
I am not sure why this happens, but if it does, simply open all 3 of the list's.
Any list you want to keep empty, type a space, delete it, then save the script.

Some people have had trouble placing the scripts into their ears, tail, or nose. Usually the nose. In this case, take the part off your body and rez it on the ground. You should then be able to place the script.
